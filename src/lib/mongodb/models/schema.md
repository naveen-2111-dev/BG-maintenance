# üì¶ MongoDB Driver Usage (Schema-less)

This project uses the official **MongoDB driver (`mongodb`)** for direct database access.  
Unlike Mongoose, the driver is *schema-less*‚Äîdocuments can have varying structures.  
To keep track of the logical schemas we use across collections, this doc serves as a reference.
